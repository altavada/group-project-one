# MuziQuest

## Description

- The motivation behind this project was to create a site for music lovers to find information about their favorite musical artists.
- When the user inputs an artist's name the site will display their discography along with the year that the albums came out.
- We learned a ton about how to use APIs and how to use the Bulma framework.

## Installation
