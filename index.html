                        Used to spend my nights out in a barroom<br>
                        Liquor was the only love I'd known<br>
                        But you rescued me from reaching for the bottom<br>
                        And brought me back from being too far gone<br>
                        <br>
                        You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey<br>
                        You're as sweet as strawberry wine<br>
                        You're as warm as a glass of brandy<br>
                        And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time<br>
                        <br>
                        I've looked for love in all the same old places<br>
                        Found the bottom of the bottle's always dry<br>
                        But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it<br>
                        'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high<br>
                        <br>
                        You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey<br>
                        You're as sweet as strawberry wine<br>
                        You're as warm as a glass of brandy<br>
                        And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time<br>
